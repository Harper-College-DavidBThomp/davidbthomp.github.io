<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This class (Computer Information Systems 106) served as a starting point for some of the fundemental concepts of programming. The concepts being presented are tested using a graphical flowchart program called Flowgorithm and then extended using JavaScript. This project had to option of choosing other langauges, but learning JavaScript inside-out was my objective at the time. Dave Braunschweig is the teacher and had access to edit files, changes can be seen in the commits, but for the most part all the code and assignments are fully completed by the students (me).

## Assignment Analysis

The rest of this serves as a historical tracker of my thought before, during, and after each project. These were addressed towards the teacher but also as a reflection for my self. Thank you for visiting and I hope you will be able to see my progress as my work continues!

### Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because it is a requirement to graduate. The major I am pursuing is A:AS Web Development. Right now I'm not too sure where I want to end up in the field but I think that becoming a web developer and then branching out from there seems like the best option. 

### Assignment 2

The programming language I selected is JavaScript. The reason I selected JavaScript is because it is the next logical step in Web Development after HTML and CSS. I thought of it as a language just primarily used on web pages and would like to see what else I am capable of doing with it. I was going to use Python but decided that diving into tools that I will likely always be using is more important. I'm sure Python would be useful to know, but JavaScript takes priority in Web Development as far I know. The IDEs I decided to go with is Visual Studio Code. I was using Sublime Text 3 which I liked, but it isn't used as commonly and Visual Studio code has many more extensions and tools to use. 

### Assignment 3

For this assignment I learned a massive amount about JavaScript and Flowgorithm. But, in general I learned that programming is very selective with the syntax and order of what you write. For example, because JavaScript is mostly used in the background of webpages the default way to display text is with "window.alert". This doesn't work when using it as a stand-alone as far as I understand because there is no webpage, but simple a console for the inputs and outputs. Instead, I had to rely on the "console.log" command which isn't as commonly mentioned for displaying results. Combining Flowgorithm and JavaScript allowed me to understand how constants, variables, and operators work together to take data and give different results.

### Assignment 4

Assignment 4 functioned more as an extension of what I had to learn on assignment 3. I got a much better grasp on how to add variables into the string outputs to make the outputs seem more personal. I learned that navigating programs to keep them as simple as possible is important. For assignment 3 I tried to limit the user input to only numbers, but because of NaN it wouldn't allow for anything but integer and floats to be entered anyway! This means that if I use any variables in arithmetic, I don't necessarily have to worry about users inputting anything other than numbers. I will look more into how to only allow number inputs though. 

### Assignment 5

This assignment was especially difficult for me, even though it isn't completed on the first day. The JavaScript as I can tell is barely not working, but the flowgorithm does. I got help from Hasfsa Hussaini and will likely need help again on day 2. I don't think I'm making a connection on how parameters, functions, and variables interact with each other. I feel like I slightly understand the concepts but don't know how to place what where. After getting my parameters correct I have a much stronger grasp on functions. 

### Assignment 6

Once again it took me a bit longer to figure this out simply because I missed out on one parameter. I did learn that when storing values from calculations they must always be stored in a variable, while outputs can simply be printed because it won't have changing values. I did peer a little bit into arrays and how to get multiple variables back from one function, but didn't use it because that seems to be a bit more advanced and will be explained in later lessons. 

### Assignment 7

The concepts for assignment 7 aren't super complex to me, the idea of logic and "if-then" statements make sense. I think I'm having a bit of trouble understanding where to use these though. I learned that when making a program using these concepts can allow for much more complex programs to be made that are much more responsive. Instead of linear programs that are simple to break, we can now make programs that can respond to different inputs and give different outputs. I also learned how much more efficient doing this can be, essentially making some of the code used and some of not, will reduce the resources used by said program.


### Assignment 8

I learned that when programming using while loops are super useful tools. They can automate tasks such as gathering data from a user to creating data based on what a user inputs. I learned about changing what the variables mean in the loop in order to make to loop operational. We also used more boolean than before to define when the loop would continue or stop. This can be applied to create programs that run on a daily basis or even an hourly basis to automate the tasks that need to be done. The activity 2 JavaScript isn't completely functioning yet, I just can't get the total value of all the inputs. This was fixed by having the numbers read as an integer rather than string. 

### Assignment 9

This assignment was extremely valuable at showing me the value of how a do loop can make code much simpler to repeat. It felt very bulky at first, in the sense that it pretty much wrapped all my code to make the operations repeat. But after using it in activity 1 it felt much more reasonable. Rather than having to keep track of when a user reaches a certain boolean value, we can now have the user enter a value that validates a boolean equation. This is useful because instead of users having to know the number of values to enter, they are free to enter as many as they'd like. The most useful thing I got from this is that repeating the whole string of code makes the program much more usable. Rather than having to restart the execution of the code, you can simply loop them back to the start.. 

### Assignment 10

In this assignment, it felt more like applying what we learned about all the loops to have them work together. It was a bit more simple than learning about the loops themselves. It also displayed how certain loops can make certain tasks simpler. For loops are the better option when doing a count of any type, while do loops are better at taking user inputs for know if to repeat. Nesting loops inside each other allow for everything that we learned about loops to be done all together. Each one of the assignments showed progressively how loops allow more and more freedom to the programmer and user.

### Assignment 11

This was a real challenge that I couldn't get done in one day. Creating static data for a fixed array wasn't super complex, but getting to it seems to be the problem I am running into for Activity 1 Defined Value Arrays. For the next assignment, I am running into trouble reading the values of the array as a constant it seems. I can't pinpoint the exact problem but when I try to read the math.min and math.max of the array I am getting no values. Besides all this, arrays seems useful in storing multiple variables of data. They can simplify large inputs of data into one consolidated area. This is also useful for looking at data trends for research and as an alternative to creating lists. 

### Assignment 12

This assignment ending up serving as an extension of assignment 11 because I did assignment 11 incorrectly. By doing assignment 11 incorrectly, I managed to learn more about dynamic arrays than I knew about static. Now I have a pretty good basic understanding of how both work and why it seems we will exclusively use dynamic in most cases. Dynamic arrays are way more flexible with better ways to get data in and out. I also learned why it's so much better to put arrays into their function rather than bunching them with other processing data. Arrays are a way to get inputs and store them, not process them in the same space. Arrays also allow for the sorting of data to make it more readable and understandable for the programmer and users. Like I mentioned in assignment 6, learning them seemed pretty useful and they are now that I know what they are. 

### Assignment 13

The ability to take strings and modify them is critical to proper outputs for the user. These modifications can also make the data received much more legible and useful for the programmer. For example, if a user inputs information but in incorrect form, we can use strings to correct that so it can still be used. I also learned about the various ways that JavaScript can modify strings to correct for whitespace and capitalize. The ability to separate string input values into an array means that each word or string is much more accessible. I also learned Javascript has powerful tools such as trim() to help with whitespace management. 

### Assignment 14

Using arrays and strings together to try to read a file type that is externally connected to the posed a challenge in the sense that .txt files created on windows have some weird attributes to them such as a return "\r" anywhere you press enter. Getting the code to come out of the notepad without taking extra things I didn't need was difficult but made easier with split, which makes it into an array. Even harder is trying to validate the existence and name of the file. I believe I got the manipulation of the text in the file down, but I don't quite fully understand how to know what file is being given to the code. I also learned a bit about errors and how we can try something even though we know it will be an error and still give the user output. 

### Final Project

This assignment brings forth most of the stuff that we learned to make the best program that we can. I mostly learned about JavaScript and the limitations of the little I learned, but I also understood that the little I did know as applicable to make a working program. I have learned so many things about programming over this course, but the things that stick out the most are parameters, arguments, and string. Before this course, I had dabbled into a few languages, but with the projects and readings, I feel like I can put together almost any language that you throw at me on a surface level. One large thing that isn't within the course but is part of it is navigating git-hub. Now that I have this knowledge I can navigate the site and understand what I do. I also learned the value of having reliable resources to ask questions to, I never really used teachers or TA's/SA's before this course. Overall, I have to say this course has taught me soo much about coding in an enjoyable way. It has shown me that classes can not only be challenging, but fun!
