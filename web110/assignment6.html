    <h1>Assignment 6</h1>

    <p>
        The first activity introduces the various internet technologies available to us. These are all things we are
        likely to be familiar with their existence, but now we have a way to categorize and organize the differences
        between them. I learned about communication services such as mail and messaging, information retrieval services
        such as file transfers, web services, and the World Wide Web which are documents on the internet. In the future,
        being able to understand which of these services operate within which framework will help me connect users to
        the correct utility for what they want to do.<br><br>

        The third activity was researching and using remote desktop applications. I have always been one to try to
        remote desktop connect to help relatives and friends with computer issues. I know some of the free programs, but
        I tried Google Remote Desktop. I learned of the functionalities of more complex remote desktop applications, but
        the Chrome application is fast, usable on multiple devices, and most importantly, free. In the future, I will
        probably personally use it when I'm out of the house and need more computing power or need to run applications
        on the desktop. I can also use it to troubleshoot issues for other users, but once again, I think other programs
        are more robust for that purpose.<br><br>

        The last activity I did was 5, which was a page by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The
        page was about copyright infringement and the general guidelines of what infringement is. I learned that all
        music, whether digital or physical, is protected fully by US law. I also learned that there are sites and
        exceptions to this rule, to which they provide a website to royalty-free music. I also learned that you burn
        music you have already paid royalties to, as long it's for personal use and not a commercial distribution. This
        is useful because my family has two DJ's who have tens of thousands of CDs and vinyl records. Condensing this to
        a hard drive or fewer discs is likely a move they should make. </p>
