    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>

    <p>
        The first thing I learned about is how Firefox introduced labeling non-SSL sites as dangerous before chrome.
        Chrome also does as well now. This type of warning can protect users who are less familiar with the web from
        getting scammed or viruses. I also found the section about search engines and the terms that can be used in
        order to refine your search extremely useful. Refining the search can allow for users to find information that
        they need much quicker with a better result. There was also a really good refresher on the technologies used to
        get internet connectivity such as Dial-Up, DSL, and Satellite. Knowing the differences between these methods
        allows for recommendations for which to use.<br><br>

        For the second assignment of the class, I learned about the multiple ways to access your IP address. I was
        familiar with the process through CMD using "ipconfig" but didn't know about the other method through Windows
        10. Knowing how to get your private IPV4 address allowed me to port forward so people can access a server I
        operate. Professionally, I imagine it can be used the same, as a way to create and run a server from home. From
        the activities, I learned the common sites and methods of geolocation from IP addresses. Being able to find
        where people are is a scary prospect, but I understand that there are ways around this.<br><br>

        The third and final assignment was understanding traceroute. Traceroute is a tool that can be used to see how
        your data travels from one location to another. This tool makes it so that seeing slow points and other faults
        with connections are clear. The use must be extensive to see who is accessing what data and when. It is
        mentioned the use in law enforcement, but I imagine it would be useful for people with malicious intent as well.
