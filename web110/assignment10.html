    <h1>Assignment 10</h1>

    <p>
        Session 10 expanded on what we learned about HTML to style our webpages. I learned that when styling pages
        elements that we nest our information in appropriate areas. By doing this when we style our pages we will have
        more control over multiple sections so that they can have good design. We wouldn't want our Navbar or footer to
        be larger text than the header of the web page. I also learned that there are different ways to do the same
        thing nearly, such as using "margin" rather than "border". These subtle differences can the difference between
        knowledgeable web designers and poor web designers. In the future, I will be able to use CSS to create webpages
        that aren't only accessible, understandable, and reliable, but also aesthetically pleasing to use.
