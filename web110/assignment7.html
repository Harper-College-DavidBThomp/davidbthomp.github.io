    <h1>Assignment 7</h1>

    <p>
        The second activity has us reviewing the IP settings for the local network. It goes through the various
        operating systems you might be using. An IP address is a unique combination of numbers to identify your address,
        much like a real address. I've had to run the ipconfig command multiple times and this time I looked in-depth at
        what information is being presented. I learned that typing "/all" after ipconfig provides much more data about
        the network settings. It provided me with an Ethernet adapter setting such as what device it is, the MAC
        address, and what is enabled or disabled. This will be useful in the future to diagnose and review settings
        quickly. I have already used this to get information about my computer's IP to run servers.<br><br>

        Next, I did the third activity, which is verifying different parts of my internet connectivity. It is rather
        surprising as someone who is so familiar with computers, but I learned about the different lights associated
        with being physically plugged into the network. Another thing I learned about using the tracert command to see
        where the connection is possibly failing. All of these commands are useful when diagnosing possible issues and
        helping to isolate the said issue. If you run a tracert and it fails somewhere down the line, it likely isn't an
        issue on your part, but if you run it and it fails immediately you might want to inspect your equipment first.<br><br>

        The final activity I did was activity 4. I knew going into it that sharing on Windows has changed drastically
        over time. I remember when it was a shared network folder, or when I could use the router to store files for
        everyone to use. I learned that today's best practice recommended by Microsoft is using their integrated One
        Drive to share the file or to email it. I also learned that in professional environments there are files that
        can be shared over the network in file explorer. In the future I might have to be able to quickly transfer files
        over the network for use, but also I will have to know how to manage these transfers. There are so many options
        of cloud sharing that in the future I believe it will be more and more common to have fewer and fewer files on
        youur computer and more on the cloud.
