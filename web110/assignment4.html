    <h1>Assignment 4</h1>

    <p>
        Activity 1 was an overview of email and it's functions. I learned about the different features of an email that
        I never used before. I understand the usefulness of these features in their different contexts, such as the "cc"
        and "Bcc" options that I've never touched before. I know this will be useful in the future because some emails,
        especially in a professional environment, will have to be sent to multiple people to get information to them.
        There was also mention of how suites such as Microsoft Outlook have tools to manage calendars, contacts, and
        other features. I understand that these programs have many tools, but many web-based email systems have been
        adapting and improving to add these features.<br><br>

        Activity 2 has us using our email as usual. I normally use the Windows Mail program to send and receive from
        multiple inboxes, but I wanted to see what using the web-based email was like. This taught me that the
        differences that email clients offer are expansive, to a point where using the client versus the original are
        completely different experiences. In the future, knowing this I will try to stay consistently updated on the
        different email setups and their advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>

        Activity 4 has us learning about tracing and managing emails. The amount of information that goes into an email
        is staggering. At first, a message from Indeed looked basic enough. But, when I opened the email information I
        was greeted with the filtering tests it passes, domain tests, and other tests. It also said how long it took to
        deliver the message from its original send time, so next time someone says they sent me an email at a certain
        time and I don't get it until an hour later, I can check the validity of their statement.
