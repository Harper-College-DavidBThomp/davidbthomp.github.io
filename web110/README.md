<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This class is the baseline to understand what HTML and CSS are and their function in a web page. A lot of the class is building on concepts that I can expand into further and more in depth down the line. The page operates like a sketch board, onto which I put any knowledge which I learned. It isn't pretty, but it is the humble begginings I come from.

### Built With

* HTML
