    <h1>Assignment 8</h1>

    <p>
        The first activity was pages about the different ways to be safe on the Internet. I learned that being safe on
        the Internet isn't limited to a few things, but is multifaceted and complex. There are hundreds of ways to
        secure your accounts, data, and general computer well being. It can start with the wi-fi, the software you
        enabled on your computer, and what websites you access. I think that the analogy used that was very useful is
        "treat the Internet like a mall, you wouldn't hand your information over to someone you don't trust.". I think
        this is important int he future because knowing many of the vulnerabilities that users or your self may run
        into, will allow for more preparation and counteractive measures.<br><br>

        The fourth activity was researching password managers and multi-factor authentication methods. I ended up
        choosing and using LastPass, mainly because of its robust free version. I learned that other premium programs
        often come packed with other features such as VPNs, cloud storage, and other monitoring features to keep users
        safe. Personally, in the future, this will allow me to chose a product that will meet all my needs and keep me
        safe on the Internet.<br><br>

        The fifth activity was the final activity I did. The page led to a test of your network and the possible
        vulnerabilities that it has. After running some tests I learned that the most dangerous part of my network is
        how the UPnP for the router may allow some ports to remain open. On my personal computer, the firewall and other
        features Windows disables appears to be keeping my data safe. In the future, I will use a test like this to see
        the vulnerabilities of private networks I might connect to on a regular basis such as a friend's home. I will be
        able to tell them of these vulnerabilities and hopefully offer some ways to defend themselves.
