    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>

    <p>
        Activity 1 included two pages about internet browsers and common internet usage. I asked a question on the
        discussion board about Flash Player and sure enough one of the pages is about that. Flash player can be a
        vulnerability on computers and should be disabled unless using from a fully trusted source. There was also
        another interesting page about URL shorteners and how websites create their own or we can create our own to
        share with others. I knew of the YouTube shortener but not of Twitter or WordPress. This is useful because when
        sending a link it can take up lines and lines of text instead of simply being an easy small link to click. This
        can make users less wary of clicking certain links because they can read where it directs them more easily.<br><br>

        Activity 2 displayed the versatility and subtle difference between web browsers. I have settled into Brave as my
        browser of choice because of not getting ads and privacy. But after opening Firefox and Chrome I could still see
        the appeal in both of them. Firefox had a much larger interface that notified me of things the browser did as
        well as things I could do. This is useful to get full use of the browser, cause without that information I might
        miss out on something. Chrome and Brave are very similar in the sense that brave is knock off of Chrome.
        Microsoft Edge recently got redone to compete with in the market and seems much more usable and friendly
        compared to its ancient Internet Explorer. Overall spending a few minutes browsing on a different browser every
        few months might users decide which one they prefer, but will also help determine limitations of the browsers
        they use now.<br><br>

        Activity 5 discussed plug-ins which are more commonly known as extensions now. The article was very insightful
        to how older browsers used plug-ins as a means to run most of the media and other tools of the internet that we
        take for granted today. I am very familiar with extensions and love ad-blocker, LastPass, and Grammarly. Passing
        these extensions onto others would prove beneficial for their productivity as well as their leisure
