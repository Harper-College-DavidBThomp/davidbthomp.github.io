    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>

    <p>
        The first activity involves reading a tutorial and some information about the various social media websites. It
        was interesting to see the odd sites that I've never heard of in my life. I knew of Facebook and Twitter, but
        sites such as Faceparty and Flickr are unfamiliar. Some of the sites are just outdated and dead, such as
        Faceparty. Flickr still seemed updated and relevant, possibly even useful? It's very hard to predict the future,
        but based on how many social media sites have come and gone, I think that the use will be more centralized as it
        already has been. Facebook has billions of users, Snapchat has millions if not billions yet. Staying within the
        popular sites will help keep mine or others' presence online.<br><br>

        The second activity has us making an account for a site and using it. Personally, I try to avoid social media,
        so I just used my Facebook account that I keep activated cause I use it to log in to so many things. The site
        provided by Wikiversity is a bit outdated, but Facebook has actually made it astonishingly clear and easy how to
        manage contacts and privacy. I think this is useful because Facebook is one of the most popular social media
        websites and I will be able to help others manage their information online.<br><br>

        The final activity was using the Honeycomb model to evaluate websites and their robustness within that
        framework. Once again I choose to evaluate Facebook. The truth is, Facebook is a fantastic website that nearly
        perfectly meets all of these parameters and in recent times they have been trying their best to fix the
        tarnished parts. Facebook's identity and reputation are terrible, so all of their marketing has been trying to
        get this to appear better. They have also created better privacy control and access to data. I think the
        Honeycomb model is super robust and can help decide which social media sites are productive and which are more
        gimmicky. In the future, this will be useful to evaluate my own or business needs online to match them to the
        correct platform.
