        Activity 2 had us use other search engines and look up the same thing to see the results, and it honestly
        surprised me a little. I expected each of the individual search engines to pull up their pages when looking for
        a search engine, but maybe they expect the user to have good enough sense to know they are using their search
        engine. This also exposed me to other search engines because I have never used Yahoo or Ask before in my life.
        Ask felt extremely outdated and out of place but all the other web search engines faired fairly well. Some felt
        like they were throwing a ton of ads at you and others felt less biased than google in their result. I think in
        the present I could work on learning how to refine my searches on Google, as it seems to be the dominant force
        in the market.<br><br>

        Activity 4 exposed us to the concept of search engine optimization (SEO). I learned that SEO comes on many
        levels and arguably is one of the most important parts of getting your website noticed. Going into Web
        Development is likely to expose me to pages that need to get more attention by messing with the SEO. I
        understand a little bit of analytics as well as using keywords for SEO, but learning more about how to get users
        to a website will help me improve my track record.<br><br>

        Activity 5 had us using an internet archiver to see older webpages that aren't available anymore. I am familiar
        with the way back machine and how to use it, so I went to look at pages I used a long time ago. I learned that
        even though pages come and go, it is likely that if it was popular enough that it archived and still findable
        today. Archivers are useful because if a page was useful, this tool to find and use that page.
