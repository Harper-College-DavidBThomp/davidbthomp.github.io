## Assignment 1

I am taking this course to understand more about back-end web development and to learn skills that will help me in the real world to manage or create websites. I am taking this course specifically now because it runs during the fall and I would prefer to graduate in a year rather than 2. Because of the way the classes are run during specific semesters, I have to jump ahead to this class before doing classes that are more in line with my knowledge. Unfourantely, this course seems much more advanced than anything I have learned so far but I going to try my best to overcome this challenge. 

## Assignment 2

I learned that server-side scripting has much more depth when it comes to interacting with the clients' web page. I also learned how we can put multiple files in our container using various methods. I was able to understand that using these methods will allow me to host multiple webpages on a single site. This is useful because most websites aren't one dimensional on one page, they span multiple pages with various types of content. In the future using docker and express to host websites like this is useful because if I run it on my own servers, I won't have to rely on third-party hosting services to contain my site. 

## Assignment 3

In this session, I learned about processing requests and updating webpages so that users can get feedback. To do this, I had to learn about how to put forms using templates so that the feedback and be seen. I also learned about GET and POST requests which are used to get information from a specified source and then to send data back and update a resource. Creating these forms will help me in the future by having the ability to collect and store data that users provide. I can also make it so that inputs have responses so that inputs aren't repeated.

## Assignment 4

This assignment taught me how to use requests and loops in a way that allows me to intake multiple inputs and store the data using express. I learned about a key function of hidden elements and the ability to templates to interact with the webpage more dynamically. In the future, I will be able to use these techniques to have pages that intake multiple inputs. Adding input validation would allow for more complex things to be processed. This also allowed me understand the differences between GET and POST requests a bit more and why they are used in certain cases.

## Assignment 5

This session involved getting data from an external file and converting it so it is readable in a table. In order to this, I had to learn how express-file upload worked and how to get that data into an array. After validating that the file exists, I sorted the information into an array and separated that array into individual pieces of data. Once that is done I was able to do the math and other sorting methods in order to add more information into the table such as the MPH and scale of the storm. This is all useful because being able to intake data and manipulate it makes it so that we can create useful information for tables. 

## Assignment 6

In this session, we learned about arrays and processing multidimensional arrays to create groups of data. This was the first time I've ever used a multimetal array, which made me learn how to process data in arrays, insert data, and order the data. I learned how useful arrays are for processing data in the background rather than explicitly going through each number. By storing similar data in the same array variable, we can go through the process using loops for all the data. I also learned by using multidimensional arrays we can choose how we sort our data and keep it all grouped. In the future I arrays will be useful to keep information for multiple variables, for single users. I can see how this translates into storing data for individual users. 

## Assignment 7

This assignment has us learning about associative arrays or dictionaries. I learned how to create dictionaries in JavaScript and insert data so that the array indexes are defined. This is useful so that our array has key values, which can be called. In some languages this allows us to map and do other functions such as insert, delete, and lookup parts of the data that we want access to. This lesson is starting to blur the line between databases and database languages such as SQL and JavaScript. I don't mean that in a way of mixing the two up, but the possible way JavaScript can work as a database. In the future using this will help keep data in arrays sorted, which is important when scaling upwards. 

## Assignment 8

In this session, I learned about some of the forms that data comes in over the internet. I have heard of JSON and XML but have never interacted with them. This lesson taught me interactions with these data types in a way that can query it like a database. To do this I had to learn how to request information from the page, and then sort the data when it's given. Doing this allowed me to extract data from each value that I needed. In the future, I will use this in order to query and sort information from various sources over the internet. The standards used are very common, being one of the de-facto standards from W3C.

## Assignment 9

In this lesson, we learned about integrating SQL into our code to create a database. This was done by creating a database and using SQL commands to manipulate the data. I learned how to insert, delete, update, and create tables for SQLite. I also learned the purpose and function of how a database can interpret data from our HTML. In the future, using a database to store data whether for an E-Commerce site, user login data, or information tracking will be common practice. 

## Assignment 10

This lesson introduced me to NoSQL, more specifically MongoDB. To use MongoDB I had to learn the associated terms and methods that are used to create, query, and delete data in the database.  The most in-depth part I came to understand was querying and the format of how a NoSQL database would look. Instead of a relational database, there are key pair values that are used instead. This allows for a lot more flexibility and size. Using NoSQL databases in the future will be important to understand, they seem to become more and more relevant with big data every year. 

# Assignment 11

In this session, I learned about Redis, a key-value database that allows us to store data. I learned about the different ways to use the database to create specific data types, such as hashes, strings, and lists. I learned how these all differ in very subtle ways, that change the way data is stored. I also learned how to use the commands in Redis to store, create, and update a database. I found out that key-value databases do a great job of being lightweight and quick, making their use to get and store data extremely robust. The data itself though isn't super organized as a tradeoff. In the future using key-value databases will allow me to store information and retrieve it in a JSON-like format. 

# Assignment 12

In this session, I learned about cookies and sessions. I learned that using cookies allows the user to store data in the browser. This can be useful to cache information that might be used over and over again. Sessions operate in a similar capacity to cookies, but the database or server will access this information. This works more like a read and writes operation rather than just write and delete for cookies. In the future, I will use these skills to help auto-complete forms, as well as using sessions to get information about what pages users should have access to. 

## Assignment 13

In this session, we learned about REST APIs and their function. I learned that making a site RESTful means being able to access resources from pages without changing their destination. I also learned how RESTful applications are intended to ease communication between the different resources. This typically includes formatting data in a way such as JSON. This communication is stateless, meaning no client information is stored between requests. Typically we can query a site using the URL with query parameters. RESTful sites also allow for different methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, each used to do different functions.

## Assignment 14

In this session, we learned about testing software for our websites. More specifically, I learned about web testing, which is used to test different parts of websites. This is typically done in prototyping and allows for mistakes to be found, as well as things that might not be considered such as security and load-bearing. I also learned about how some testing software creates virtual users to check performance metrics. This will be useful in the future because websites that aren't able to perform speedily, typically lose a lot of the viewers. This also can expose possible security issues that wouldn't be found until the site is live, and those issues are already exploited. 

## Final Project

For the final project, I had to learn a lot about how to make the backend of the website do CRUD operations and manage the website. I learned so much about the various technologies being used to create and manage websites. Some research has pointed me towards the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS). All of these being new things that I learned about this semester. Overall, nearly everything done this semester was a learning experience and will be valuable to reference as I continue to learn and become a full-stack developer.
