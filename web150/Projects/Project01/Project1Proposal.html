    <h1>Project 01 Proposal</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Concept Statement</h2>
        The subject of my website is going to be about the different recovery methods from exercise and the history of
        said methods.<br>

        My audience is going to be athletes and those who exercise. This is most likely going to fall in the 15-25 age
        range.<br>

        I plan to cover 3 major forms of recovery; ice/heat therapy, stretching, and sleep. The content will
        be how its performed and the background/origins of it.

        <h2>Interface Design</h2>
        The interface of the website will be compact with examples of the information I am presenting. Typing paragraphs
        won't really help users understand what the form of recovery is or how it is performed. The majority of the text
        will the science behind it or history.<br>

        I want to look at the page and feel like I can trust what is being said, so a message that I am giving
        legitimate advise.<br>

        The message I want to communicate is that of a level of professionalism; well placed appropriate images, videos,
        and tools to help users understand the concepts being presented.
