                <h2 class="goldenbottom">Nature</h2>
                <p class="boxesparagraph">While nature isn't the first thing we think of when going to a desert in
                    seemingly the middle of nowhere, Nevada and states nearby are home to some of the most beautiful
                    parks in the nation. Nevada can not only serve as a base for adventuring the South-West but as a
                    place its-self to explore. Roam the desert in the heat of the South-West the same as the cowboys.
                    Maybe you'll find your golden<br> location out there.

                style="background: rgb(0, 0, 0) url(img/Entertainment\ Background\ BW.jpg) no-repeat center; background-size: cover;">
                <h2 class="goldenbottom">Entertainment</h2>
                <p class="boxesparagraph">We all know Vegas for the gambling and adult shows, but the other
                    lesser-explored side deserve a chance to shine. World-class
                    comedic acts, nail-biting performances, and graceful art are all in-store at the right place. But,
                    the fun doesn't stop there. One moment you can be taking a picture by a model statue of liberty, and
                    then in a canoe in France. The adventures possible in this <br>mini-world are endless!

                <h2 class="goldenbottom">Dining</h2>
                <p class="boxesparagraph">In Vegas, the food industry is survival of the fittest, be the best or get
                    out. The turnover rate is high which some see as a problem. But instead, this turns into a
                    playground of food experimentation. The bedrock restaurants have been tested by time and competition
                    to be the best. The new restaurants are trying to establish a name for themselves. The variety of
                    fine dining, fast food, and something in-between means options will never run out.
