## Assignment 1

I am taking this course as an introduction to JavaScript and it's application to the front-end of websites. I am currently taking this class concurrently with WEB 250 which is using NodeJS on the back-end. I have been waiting to dive into JavaScript fully and this semester is going to be full of it. I plan to use JavaScript in the future to make my website modern, robust, and interactive. I know it adds a lot of capability to websites and is one of the 3 basic languages of the front-end. The past, present, and future of websites are dependent on a web developer's ability to use these languages in conjunction, JavaScript being one of the critical ones. 

## Assignment 2

This assignment taught me how to integrate JavaScript into my page while using buttons. Before I knew how to use window.alert but found this rather intrusive and annoying. Not only will integrating the buttons on the page be more useful in the future, but it also allows me to customize the experience a lot more by changing the HTML and CSS.  I also learned more about managing the functions that I have in my JavaScript. Initially, I was trying to just run everything in order from top to bottom with no functions splitting anything apart. When I used the functions the processing of the JavaScript made a lot more sense and functioned better. In the future, I will 100% be using JavaScript like this in order to customize the user experience of a website that I design.

## Assignment 3

This assignment has us working on using and integrating functions so that everything isn't working as a global parameter. This taught me that using functions to break up our code not only makes it more manageable but also more functional because we can easily debug and edit things when needed. I also learned how to essentially create prompts in the HTML using buttons. This will help the pages and data I create to be more user friendly. In the future, I believe I will always being using functions within JavaScript to manage and create code as it is standard practice. Without functions, we can easily get lost and ruin code.

## Assignment 4

Session 4 has us learning about event and their purpose in JavaScript. I jumped the gun in session 3 using them but got to learn more by watching the videos and visiting the sites on the Wikiversity page. I learned about the events that are on-hover, on-load, on-unload, and mouse tracking. I learned that events are useful ways to run your JavaScript functions if you are waiting for user input. In the future, I will use this to get information from users and most likely will use JavaScript to send this information to another file or database. I imagine this will also be useful for creating super interactive sites that move with the user and interact with the user.

## Assignment 5

This session was focused on the use of conditional statements to make our programs have options. Conditional statements allow us to pick and choose what happens after certain conditions are met. This is a fundamental building block of many tools and operates a bit differently from the previous lesson of events. Events make something happen, conditional statements choose what happens when that event is met. This introduces other issues such as breaking the statement and preventing loops from happening. These actions taking place based on different conditions is useful in the future because it is a basic element of coding. Without the ability to use conditionals, we would be left with an only very basic use of the language. 

## Assignment 6

In this session, we studied the application of using loops in JavaScript. We use these loops and tricks to make the code more simplified and more robust code. We can even do things such as nesting loops within loops to make it so that multiple conditions are met. This concept builds on our knowledge of what boolean is and how it can be used to make equations. Using loops is a super common attribute for much of the code that is written. In the future, loops aren't going anywhere because of their fundamental purpose in coding. 

## Assignment 7

In this session, we learned about loops and their purpose. Rather than while loops, for loops, typically have multiple conditions for a program to keep running until those conditions that are defined are met. These loops execute that specified amount of times and allow us to skip numbers or start and numbers. This allows nested loops to execute a certain amount of times within the parent loop so that the condition of the parent loop is dependent on the child. This means that we can run a loop within a loop. In the future for loops will be useful for managing code, because it seems more compact than while loops. I know each has a specific application so learning more will be critical. 

## Assignment 8

In this session, we learned about arrays and their abilities. This allows us to transport multiple values that we get from one function to another. Storing these values is as simple as pushing the data into the array that we create. Using template literals and extracting that information for use is also done using other methods. I also learned that arrays don't start with 1 but rather 0 for the first value entered. This is important because it could cause you to use or put in incorrect data. This is useful because most data that we get won't be one simple answer but rather multiple answers we will have to pass between multiple functions. In the future storing data with arrays becomes more important because most stuff we create won't be so dimensional.

## Assignment 9

In this assignment, I learned a lot about how time and date works using JavaScript. One thing that gave me trouble was converting or managing the default UTC when getting the date as an ISO default. I learned to fix this that I can simply input the user's local hour and then it will use their time instead of UTC. I also learned how to manage dates piece by piece instead of as a whole. The methods I learned were intuitive and most of the time self-explanatory for what they did. In the future, I will be able to use dates and their abilities to make pages more interactive as well as create sites that might use dates and times to change various aspects of the page.
